Exercise 2

1) Complete the first MPI exercise (MPI hello world) and compile it with the compiler (mpiicc or mpiifort) in the module intelmpi/2017--binary (default)
Find the exercise here: https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/training/summer-school/tree/master/MPI/Exercise_01

2) Check with:
$ ldd <executable>
the list of required dynamic libraries.

3) Write "job.sh" (you can copy it from exercise 1), asking for two nodes and modifying the --ntasks-per-node with the following requests:

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
Run first 32 processes and then 4 processes for each select.
