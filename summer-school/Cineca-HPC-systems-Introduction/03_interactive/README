Exercise 3

1) Launch an interactive job. You just need to write the same SLURM directives, without "#SBATCH" and on the same line, as arguments of "srun". Remember to finish the line with "--pty /bin/bash"

$ srun ... <arguments> --pty /bin/bash

2) Check whether you are on a different node 

3) Check that there's an interactive job running
